Today I tried to install a chrome extension octotree for github website. However, I keep get the error as following.

![Error Image ]({{site.baseurl}}/images /error_Chrome_extension.png)

It seems this is due to some network problem and there is no good solution for this. So I decide to try installing extensions manually instead of install it from the chrome app store. 

**This is the process:**

1. Search your_extension.crx in google and download it to your local disk;
2. Go to the setting --> extensions
3. Drag the .crx file into the extension page 
4. Done.
