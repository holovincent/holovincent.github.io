> “In this Perspective, we review the challenges of developing and translating medical technologies and highlight promising new technologies to improve health in low-resource settings.”

1. Low-resource settings present challenging design constraints, including inadequate electricity and clean water, limited funding, weak supply chains, lack of trained users, and lack of technology management policies.

2. Evaluating technology performance presents further challenges in low-resource clinics.

3. Successful product design requires multidisciplinary partnerships.

4. Here, they highlight successful efforts and remaining barriers for several technologies.

	- Laerdal developed NeoNatalie, an electricityfree, low-cost neonatal simulator that mimics chest rise with mechanical ventilation.

	- BD FACSCount is a low-cost flow cytometer, but it requires skilled operators and frequent calibration.

	- The Alere PIMA device uses a fixed-volume, static cytometer and can run on battery or solar power.

	- GeneXpert is used for MTB test.
