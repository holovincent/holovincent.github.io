TODO: 

- [ ] Add descriptions of shell sort algorithm
- [ ] Add other sort algorithm

Recently I plan to study the algorithm systematically. I have studied, used and developed several algorithms, but I think I still lack very systematical knowledge of algorithm analysis
and design. According to [Zhihu's recommendation], I will fast go through the book: Robert Sedgewick, Algorithm, 4th edition and try to get a sense of the general principle of algorithm analysis and design. 

I will write some notes here to record my study which may include the principle, illustration and implementation of of certain algorithms.

Sorting is one of the most important and fundamental problems in algorithm design and analysis.


## Elementary sort

### Selection sort

**Principle:**

1. Find the smallest item in the array and exchange it with the first entry, then this item is sorted.
2. Find the smallest item in the rest array without the sorted items and exchange it with the 1st item of the rest array.
3. Repeat step 2 until all the items are sorted.

**Complexity:**

Suppose we have N items to sort. The first item needs (N-1) comparison, and the ith item needs (N-i) comparison. So the algorithm will needs $(N-1)+(N-2)+...+0 = ~N^2/2$ times comparison. And each item needs 1 exchange. So in total, the number of comparison and exchange is $ N^2/2 + N$. The number of computation is fixed in selection sorting.

**C++ implementation:**

```cpp
// selection sort
void selectionsort(std::vector<int> &vec)
{
    int n = vec.size();
    for (int i =0; i<n; ++i)
    {
        for (int j =i; j<n; ++j) 
        {
            if (vec[i]>vec[j])
                exchange(vec,j,i);                
        }
    }
}
```

### Insertion sort

**Principle:**

**Complexity:**

**C++ implementation:**

```cpp
// insertion sort
void insertionsort(std::vector<int> &vec)
{
    int n = vec.size();
    for (int i = 1; i<n; ++i)
    {
        for (int j=i; j>0 && (vec[j]<vec[j-1]); j--)
        {
            exchange(vec, j, j-1);        
        }
    }
}
```

### Shell sort
Shell sort is a improvement of insertion sort.

**C++ implementation:**

```cpp
// shell sort
void shellsort(std::vector<int> &vec)
{
    int n = vec.size();
    int h = 1;
    while (h<n/3)
    {
        h=3*h+1;
    }       
    while (h>=1)
    {
        for (int i = h; i<n; ++i)
        {
            for (int j=i; j>=h && (vec[j]<vec[j-h]); j=j-h)
            {
                exchange(vec, j, j-h);            
            }        
        }    
        h = h/3;
    }
}
```
